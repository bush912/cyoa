  <h2> You took the key</h2>
  <p>
  <h4>Time unknown</h4>
  You decided to take the key and put it in your pocket. After walking for what seemed like forever you begin to lose hope on ever finding your way out of this place. As you continue to walk, in the distance you see a wooden door. As you get close to it you notice a key hole on the door. Suddenly you hear foot steps running at you from behind. You glance behind you and see that a monster is chasing after you. You quickly grab the key that you were so lucky to find and open the door. You jump through the door and lock it behind you. You are safe...for now...
