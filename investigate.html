		You decide to investigate the strange tv
  </h2>
	<p>
    <h4>2:38 am</h4>
      You slowly get off the couch and walk towards the tv with your hand reaching out. As you aprouch the tv, your reach out to touch the screen, as if you are being drawn to it. You are expecting to feel the warm, glass screen of the tv but instead, your fingers reach through the screen, as if reaching through water. Paniced, you try to pull your arm away, but it is too late. As if being pulled under water, you are sucked into the screen. What could possibly lie on the other side?>
