  <h2> You decide to walk out of the house to explore the forest</h2>
  <p>
  <h4>Time unknown</h4>
  Just before you walk out of your house, in the distance you can see a black siloet of a person standing still, looking straight at you. You get an uneasy feeling from it.

  <p>
    <a href="you died1.html"> Go say hi. Maybe they're friendly!</a>
    or
    <a href="escape.html"> You don't trust it. You exit out the back door of your house hoping they don't notice you</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    <a href="check parents.html"> Go back</a>
