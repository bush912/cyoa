  <h2> You decide to check on your parents</h2>
  <p>
  <h4>Time unknown</h4>
  You go upstairs to the door to your parents room. You quickly open the door and walk in, but your parents aren't there. They are not lying in bed like you expected them to be. You begin shouting for them and running around the house franticaly, but they're no where to be found. Maybe they are outside, you haven't checked outside yet. As you open the front door to your house and step outside, you see something very unnexpected... The neighborhood you knew so well has vanished, and is now replaced by a forest of tall pine trees.
