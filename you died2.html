  <h2> YOU DIED</h2>
  <p>
  <h4>Time unknown</h4>
  You go to investigate the footsteps. In the distance you can see the footsteps are coming from your mom! You run up to her to give her a big hug. But something is wrong. Its not your mom, it is a moster pretending to be your mom. The moster kills you with its razor sharp claws. Would you like to try again?
