  <h2> You look out the window</h2>
  <p>
  <h4>Time unknown</h4>
  You look out the window and notice that the neighborhood you knew well is now gone and replaced by a think forest of pine trees. In the distance you can see a black siloet of a person standing still, looking straight at you. You get an uneasy feeling from it.
