  <h2> You chose to leave the key</h2>
  <p>
  <h4>Time unknown</h4>
  You decide to not bring the key with you (not the smartest decision).After walking for what seemed like forever you begin to lose hope on ever finding your way out of this place. As you continue to walk, in the distance you see a wooden door. As you get close to it you notice a key hole on the door. Suddenly you hear foot steps running at you from behind. You glance behind you and see that a monster is running strait towards you.
