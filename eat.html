		You decide to go downstairs to look for a snack
  </h2>

    <h4>2:30 am</h4>
      You slowly get out of bed as your cat follows behind you. As you walk down the old rickidy stairs you remember that the power in your house has been out because of the storm. You walk into the kitchen to search for a late night snack, your feet are cold standing on the tile floor.
